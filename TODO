Many things to do!

(1) Better organize the language tokens. Many things are done twice.
(2) Improve the "is" capture, the second part is ignored for now.
(3) Capture if then else
(4) Avoid comparison (<, >, =, <=, >=) in minimize/maximize scopes.
(5) Allow a single comparison in constraints.
(6) Create operator "in" to avoid function in(...)
(7) Remove keyword set from set initializer set{...}
(8) ...


Keep in mind: commas are intended to separate VALUES (in parameter lists,
 sets, sequences) and semi-commas separate COMMANDS (inside constrained tuples,
sum and forall).
